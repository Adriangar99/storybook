title: 'The @storybook/test package'
---

The [`@storybook/test`](https://npmjs.com/package/@storybook/test) provides all the necessary utilities to write component tests in Storybook. It's a compilation of Storybook-instrumented versions of [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) and [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) utilities. That gives you a familiar developer-friendly syntax to interact with the DOM and make assertions, but with extra telemetry to help with debugging when using [addon-interactions](../essentials/interactions.md).
